# NDISAPI-Go

A Go library providing a comprehensive user-mode interface to the Windows Packet Filter driver for high-performance network packet interception and manipulation at the NDIS level.

## Overview

**NDISAPI-Go** is a Go implementation of the NDISAPI library, designed to interact seamlessly with the Windows Packet Filter driver. It offers Go developers a straightforward, safe, and efficient interface for filtering (inspecting and modifying) raw network packets at the NDIS (Network Driver Interface Specification) level of the Windows network stack. This library ensures minimal impact on network performance while providing powerful capabilities for building network applications such as firewalls, packet analyzers, VPNs, and more.

## Features

- **Seamless Integration**: Direct interaction with the Windows Packet Filter driver through a user-mode interface.
- **Packet Interception**: Capture inbound and outbound network packets at the data-link layer.
- **Packet Modification**: Inspect and modify network packets on the fly.
- **Packet Injection**: Inject custom packets into the network stack.
- **Multi-Adapter Support**: Interact with multiple network interfaces simultaneously.
- **High Performance**: Designed for minimal overhead, ensuring efficient network processing.
- **Thread Safety**: Safe for use in concurrent applications.

## Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows 7 or later (32-bit or 64-bit)
- **Go Version**: Go 1.18 or later
- **Windows Packet Filter Driver**: The driver must be installed on the system.
- **Permissions**: Administrator privileges are required to interact with network drivers and interfaces.

## Installation

1. **Install the Windows Packet Filter Driver**

   Download and install the Windows Packet Filter driver from the official website:

   - [Windows Packet Filter Driver](https://www.ntkernel.com/windows-packet-filter/)

2. **Install the NDISAPI-Go Package**

   Use `go get` to install the package:

   ```sh
   go get github.com/wiresock/ndisapi-go
   ```

## Usage
```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"net"
	"os"
	"os/signal"
	"syscall"

	"github.com/wiresock/ndisapi-go"
	"github.com/wiresock/ndisapi-go/driver"
)

func main() {
	api, err := ndisapi.NewNdisApi()
	if err != nil {
		log.Panic(fmt.Errorf("failed to create NDIS API instance: %v", err))
	}
	defer api.Close()
	if !api.IsDriverLoaded() {
		log.Fatalf("windows packet filter driver is not installed")
	}
	adapters, err := api.GetTcpipBoundAdaptersInfo()
	if err != nil {
		log.Panic(err)
	}

	// New instance of static filters
	staticFilter, err := driver.NewStaticFilters(api, true, true)
	if err != nil {
		log.Panic(fmt.Errorf("failed to get static filter: %v", err))
	}

	ctx := context.Background()
	filter, err := driver.NewQueuedMultiInterfacePacketFilter(
		ctx,
		api,
		adapters,
		func(handle ndisapi.Handle, buffer *ndisapi.IntermediateBuffer) (ndisapi.FilterAction, *ndisapi.Handle) {
			// Modify incoming packets here

			return ndisapi.FilterActionPass, nil
		},
		func(handle ndisapi.Handle, buffer *ndisapi.IntermediateBuffer) (ndisapi.FilterAction, *ndisapi.Handle) {
			// Modify outgoing packets here

			return ndisapi.FilterActionPass, nil
		})
	if err != nil {
		log.Panic(fmt.Errorf("failed to create queued_packet_filter: %v", err))
	}

	// Allocate a packet filter
	staticFilter.AddFilterBack(&driver.Filter{
		AdapterHandle: ndisapi.Handle{}, // empty handle applies to all adapters
		Action:        ndisapi.FilterActionPass,
		SourceAddress: net.IPNet{IP: net.ParseIP("192.168.1.100"), Mask: net.CIDRMask(0, 32)},
	})

	fmt.Printf("\n\nPacket filtering is started...\nPress Ctrl+C to stop.\n\n")
	if err := filter.StartFilter(); err != nil {
		log.Panic(err)
	}
	defer filter.Close()
	defer staticFilter.Close()
	{
		osSignals := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
		signal.Notify(osSignals, os.Interrupt, syscall.SIGTERM)
		<-osSignals
	}
}
```
